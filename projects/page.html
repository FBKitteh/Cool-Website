            <p>The past few months, I've been working on the KB Project. I've accomplished a few things, and realized certain parts of this project might take longer than expected. So far, I've finished working on a lot of the local functionality, so computers or devices connected to the same network can send posts and upvote/downvote posts and see them update live across the network. The design isn't exacly final, but it's getting there. I'm on pretty good track to get to each deadline with where I've gotten so far, so things are looking pretty good.</p>
