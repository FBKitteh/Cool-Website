            <p>I recently joined an internship at Walmart in the International Technology Merchandising section. We're just getting into the big projects yet to come. Firstly, I met my mentor and we talked about what is in store for me. I've yet to get my laptop to begin workling, but that will happen around the end of Christmas Break. I've been given some materials to help me learn about what's we will be working on, and I'm really excited for what's to come.</p>
