            <p>When Guest Speaker Jason Viator came to Ignite today, he shared some interesting messages. He told us about his time at Walmart and how they were dealing with Virtual Learning and Virtual Working. He said that the Technology section of Walmart might keep doing Virtual Working even after COVID-19 is dealt with. I thought that was interesting, because I always thought it would be in the best interests of technologically inclined people to work from home, as it would be more efficient that way.</p>
