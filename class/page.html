            <p>This project was pretty fun, it was interesting to go out to Sam's and check out how they ran things there and ask the customers how they liked shopping there. We also got to work with the Ignite Business students as well, and that was quite interesting. My group only had one, but he was good at taking charge and helping to lead the project. I really enjoyed this project because we got the chance to get out of our comfort zone and actually go to Sam's to learn about the way the employees did things, which I just thought was super cool. It would really help me in the future, when I will have to go around to places to learn how they run things so I can apply that to my own studies.</p>

        <div class="desc">
            <p>In the Capture The Flag Project, you had a team of people who were assigned to hack into a specialized website to reveal personal information that the company help, or to access parts of the website that a new user normally couldn't access. We also got to learn about the way hackers set up their plan of attack on websites and databases. Much like your average robbery, the hackers have to figure out where they want to attack, scope out that location, develop a weapon like a virus or phishing email (an email sent that can steal the recipients data depending on what they do), deply that weapon, and successfully get away with the stolen goods. Hackers may call for a ransom to get that data deleted as well. Then, during the actual project, we learned a bit about Linux, a good OS for hacking without being tracked, and also about some programs that can read requests. We also learned about code injections and some other useful ways to get through vulnerable parts of software. It was a very fun project, and was a great learning experience too.</p>

        <div class="desc">
            <p>During my work in the Toshiba Dashbooard Project, we got to work together with a team for the first time. It was very interesting to see other people's outlooks on the problem at hand, and I enjoyed that part. We had access to certain confidential information about employee data, and we had to organize it in a way that it would be easily readable for the executives at Toshiba. We decided to do a little website that you could go on and switch from a singular employee view, or a team view, or an overlook that would show all the teams. It did require more planning skills than I expected, so I fell short at that point. But, for the most part, my time working on this project was well spent and it helped me to learn to listen to what the customer wants.</p>

        <div class="desc">
            <p>When Guest Speaker Gino Capito came to Ignite today, he shared some interesting messages. He talked about his experiences in the technology field, and shared a lot of interesting knowledge about WiFi. He mentioned that almost all resedential IP addresses start with 192.168, and that a bunch of business IP addresses start with 10, which I thought was interesting. He also talked about how jobs tend to hire more on soft skills than hard skills. For example, if he two people apply for a job, and one had signifigantly more soft skills than the other, and the other had signifigantly more hard skills than the other, he'd hire the one with more soft skills. He said that was because hard skills are a lot easier to teach to someone than hard skills. It was nice to hear that, because now I know that soft skills are pretty much essential for the workplace.</p>

            <p>When Guest Speaker Mike Meadors came to Ignite today, he shared some interesting messages. He talked about his experiences being in the Bomb Squad, and the tools they have access to. He shared that he was one of about 2200 people in the US that worked in as a member of the Bomb Squad. He had this job for quite a while, and has had access to some very cool tools. One of those being a remote controlled robot that they would use. The robot had a lot of cool features, like a gun mounted on the front, a controllable arm that was about 12 feet long, the ability to climb up many sorts of slopes, and cameras on different sides of the robot. There were some other features, but those were the main ones (as well as the most interesting). He also got to use a bomb suit, which added on to his weight by at least 90lbs. The bomb suit had ceramic inside of it to protect, and also buttons on the arm to access communications and such. Those were the most interesting things about the visit from the Bomb Squad.</p>

            <p>When Guest Speaker Tyler Orsak came to Ignite today, he shared some interesting messages. He talked about his experiences in the art and web design field. He said he started as a freelance designer, which means he worked for himself and took jobs when people needed him. One thing I thought was interesting was that he said communication is key. He said communication is vital to a civilization's growth, and he wasn't wrong. He mentioned that if you have good communication with your clients, they'll be more likely to refer to you again if they ever need your help again, or they might tell their friends about your abilities, which will lead to you getting more jobs.</p>

            <p>When Guest Speaker Adam Holland came to Ignite today, he shared some interesting messages. He shared his experiences in the security field, both physical and cyber forms. One thing he said was that back when he was just starting out in Cyber Security, hacking and stealing info was a lot easier for a normal person than it is now, which I thought was interesting. Something else he noted was that the reason big TVs have gone so far down in price in the last decade was because it is so easy to take your personal data from when you are using your TV nowadays, and your data is very valuable to advertising companies. I didn't know that, so that was cool to learn. I had always thought TVs went down in price just because the technology was easier to access.</p>

            <p>When Guest Speaker Jason Viator came to Ignite today, he shared some interesting messages. He told us about his time at Walmart and how they were dealing with Virtual Learning and Virtual Working. He said that the Technology section of Walmart might keep doing Virtual Working even after COVID-19 is dealt with. I thought that was interesting, because I always thought it would be in the best interests of technologically inclined people to work from home, as it would be more efficient that way.</p>
